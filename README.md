# UT-Project-1-

Austin Giving Connection partners with local non-profits to find individuals who have the most critical needs and allows them to set up a giving profile which outlines their needs and tells their story.  
Those who wish to donate can search profiles and chose who receives their donation(s).  This provides a more personal connection between the two and allows opportunity for relationships to develop.  The person in need has the option to identify the means in which the donor communicates (e-mail, phone, text, or non-profit).  
The search function allows the user to find recipients based on their needs and their location.
Recipient profiles will include: 
•	teenagers who are aging out of the foster care system
•	chronically homeless 
•	families who have experienced loss from natural disasters, such as floods or fires
•	families or individuals in transition due to illness or death 
•	children in transition due to family instability 

Once recipients establish a profile, they can go in and update their information at any time.  Profile input is stored in a database so that the donator can identify if their needs or location changes.
