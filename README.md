<br>
Austin Giving Connection partners with local non-profits to find individuals who have the most critical needs and allows them to set up a profile to express these needs as well as their story.
<br>
Those who wish to donate can use the search function to find recipient profiles and then choose who receives their donation(s).  This provides a more personal connection between the two and allows opportunities for relationships to develop.
<br> 
Once recipients establish a profile, they can go in and update their information at any time.  Profile input, including their current location on google maps, is stored in a real time database so that the donator can identify if a recipient's needs or location changes.  The person in need has the option to identify the means in which the donor communicates (e-mail, phone, text, or non-profit).
<br>
Recipient profiles will include: <br>
•    Teenagers who are aging out of the foster care system <br>
•    Chronically homeless <br>
•    Families who have experienced loss from natural disasters, such as floods or fires <br>
•    Families or individuals in transition due to illness or death <br>
•    Children in transition due to family instability <br>
