# UT-Project-1-

Austin Giving Connection partners with local non-profits to find individuals who have the most critical needs and allows them to set up a giving profile which outlines their needs and tells their story.
Those who wish to donate can search profiles and chose who receives their donation(s).  This provides a more personal connection between the two and allows opportunity for relationships to develop.  The person in need has the option to identify the means in which the donor communicates (e-mail, phone, text, or non-profit).
<br>
The search function allows the user to find recipients based on their needs and their location.<br>
<br>
Recipient profiles will include: <br>
•    Teenagers who are aging out of the foster care system <br>
•    Chronically homeless <br>
•    Families who have experienced loss from natural disasters, such as floods or fires <br>
•    Families or individuals in transition due to illness or death <br>
•    Children in transition due to family instability <br>
<br>
Once recipients establish a profile, they can go in and update their information at any time.  Profile input is stored in a database so that the donator can identify if their needs or location changes.<br>
